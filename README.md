#  Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Network

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model — a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. By analyzing historical stock prices, the model predicts future stock closing values, helping to understand stock trends and potential price movements.
